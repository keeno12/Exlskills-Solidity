Feel free to skip any units that you already know but there is important information that is included in all of the lectures, so it would be in your best interest to at least skim each one.

As well, we are running a live blockchain course that is independent of this, but covers some of the same information. It is recommended that you at least skim some of this material before enrolling in the live class. The live class will be far more applicable and will get much further much faster.

Good Luck! Reach out to our help platform if you have any questions!
